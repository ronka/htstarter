# Product Requirements Document: Hebrew RTL Localization

## Introduction/Overview

Convert the existing HighTechShip website to a fully Hebrew-localized, right-to-left (RTL) interface. This involves translating all text content to Hebrew, implementing RTL layout support across all components, and ensuring proper Hebrew typography and user experience. The site name "HighTechShip" will remain in English as the brand name, while all interface elements and content will be in Hebrew.

## Goals

1. **Complete Hebrew Localization**: Translate all UI text, content, and user-facing messages to Hebrew
2. **RTL Layout Implementation**: Ensure all components, forms, and layouts work correctly in RTL direction
3. **Cultural Adaptation**: Adapt the interface to Hebrew reading patterns and cultural expectations
4. **Maintain Brand Identity**: Keep "HighTechShip" as the English brand name while localizing the interface
5. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure all existing features work seamlessly in the Hebrew RTL environment

## User Stories

1. **As a Hebrew-speaking user**, I want to see all interface elements in Hebrew so that I can navigate the site naturally in my native language.

2. **As a Hebrew-speaking user**, I want the layout to flow right-to-left so that the reading experience feels natural and intuitive.

3. **As a Hebrew-speaking user**, I want to see project information, descriptions, and all content in Hebrew so that I can fully understand the available opportunities.

4. **As a Hebrew-speaking user**, I want forms and input fields to work correctly in RTL so that I can submit information without layout issues.

5. **As a Hebrew-speaking user**, I want navigation menus and dropdowns to appear on the correct side and flow properly in RTL.
