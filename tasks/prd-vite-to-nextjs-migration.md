# Product Requirements Document: Vite to Next.js App Router Migration

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the migration of the existing Vite React application to Next.js using the modern app router architecture. The current application is a project showcase platform built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The migration aims to improve developer experience while maintaining all existing functionality and leveraging Next.js app router's file-based routing system and API route capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Complete Migration**: Convert the entire Vite React application to Next.js 14+ with app router
2. **Preserve Functionality**: Maintain all existing pages, components, and user interactions without breaking changes
3. **Developer Experience**: Improve development workflow and tooling through Next.js ecosystem
4. **API Integration**: Enable backend functionality through Next.js API routes
5. **Performance**: Maintain or improve current application performance
6. **Maintainability**: Establish a more scalable and maintainable codebase structure

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to use Next.js app router so that I can benefit from file-based routing and improved developer experience
2. **As a developer**, I want to access API routes so that I can build backend functionality without external services
3. **As an end user**, I want the application to work exactly as before so that my workflow is not disrupted
4. **As a developer**, I want to maintain the current UI/UX so that the design system remains consistent
5. **As a developer**, I want improved build and development tools so that I can work more efficiently

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Routing Migration

1.1. Convert React Router DOM routes to Next.js app router file-based routing:

- `/` → `app/page.tsx` (Index page)
- `/project/[id]` → `app/project/[id]/page.tsx` (Project Detail)
- `/profile/[id]` → `app/profile/[id]/page.tsx` (Profile page)
- `/profile/[id]/edit` → `app/profile/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (Edit Profile)
- `/submit` → `app/submit/page.tsx` (Submit Project)
- `*` → `app/not-found.tsx` (404 page)

  1.2. Implement proper Next.js navigation using `next/navigation` hooks
  1.3. Maintain dynamic routing parameters (`[id]`) functionality
  1.4. Ensure all internal links use Next.js `Link` component

### 2. Project Structure Migration

2.1. Convert `src/` directory structure to Next.js `app/` directory structure
2.2. Move components to appropriate locations:

- UI components remain in `components/ui/`
- Page-specific components remain in `components/`
- Create shared layout components as needed
  2.3. Migrate utilities and hooks to Next.js compatible structure
  2.4. Update import paths to reflect new structure

### 3. Configuration Migration

3.1. Replace `vite.config.ts` with `next.config.js`
3.2. Migrate Tailwind CSS configuration to work with Next.js
3.3. Update TypeScript configuration for Next.js
3.4. Migrate ESLint configuration to Next.js standards
3.5. Update package.json scripts for Next.js commands

### 4. Dependencies Migration

4.1. Remove Vite-specific dependencies
4.2. Add Next.js and required dependencies
4.3. Ensure all existing dependencies (shadcn/ui, Radix UI, etc.) remain compatible
4.4. Update React Router DOM dependencies to Next.js navigation
4.5. Migrate React Query setup to work with Next.js

### 5. Build and Development Setup

5.1. Configure Next.js development server
5.2. Set up production build process
5.3. Ensure path aliases (`@/`) continue to work
5.4. Configure static asset handling
5.5. Set up environment variable handling

### 6. API Routes Foundation

6.1. Create basic API routes structure (`app/api/`)
6.2. Set up example API endpoints for future backend functionality
6.3. Configure API route TypeScript types
6.4. Implement proper error handling for API routes

### 7. Layout and Global Providers

7.1. Create root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) with global providers
7.2. Migrate Toaster, QueryClient, and TooltipProvider setup
7.3. Ensure proper client/server component boundaries
7.4. Set up global styles and theme providers

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Initial migration will maintain client-side behavior; SSR optimization is a future enhancement
2. **Database Integration**: No database setup or data persistence changes
3. **Authentication System**: No changes to current authentication approach
4. **New Features**: No new functionality beyond the migration itself
5. **UI/UX Changes**: No visual or interaction design modifications
6. **Performance Optimization**: Beyond what Next.js provides by default
7. **SEO Improvements**: Focus is on migration, not SEO enhancements
8. **Progressive Web App**: No PWA features in initial migration

## Design Considerations

- **Maintain Current Design System**: Keep all shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS styling exactly as is
- **Component Architecture**: Preserve existing component structure and prop interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure current responsive behavior is maintained
- **Theme Support**: Maintain existing next-themes integration
- **Accessibility**: Preserve current accessibility features

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- **Next.js**: Version 14+ for latest app router features
- **React**: Maintain current React 18+ version
- **TypeScript**: Ensure compatibility with Next.js TypeScript setup
- **Tailwind CSS**: Configure for Next.js optimization
- **shadcn/ui**: Verify compatibility and update if needed

### Configuration

- **Path Aliases**: Maintain `@/` alias for imports
- **Environment Variables**: Migrate to Next.js environment variable pattern
- **Build Output**: Configure for optimal production builds
- **Development Server**: Set up hot reloading and fast refresh

### Migration Strategy

- **Direct Conversion**: One-time migration rather than gradual
- **File-by-File**: Systematic conversion of each page and component
- **Testing**: Ensure each converted feature works before proceeding
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain Git history for easy rollback if needed

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria

1. **Functional Parity**: All existing features work identically to the Vite version
2. **Development Workflow**: Next.js development server starts and hot reload works properly
3. **Build Success**: Production build completes without errors
4. **Navigation**: All routes and navigation work correctly
5. **Component Integrity**: All UI components render and function properly

### Secondary Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: Build times are comparable or better than Vite
2. **Developer Experience**: Improved TypeScript integration and debugging
3. **API Readiness**: Basic API route structure is functional and testable
4. **Maintainability**: Code structure is organized and follows Next.js best practices

## Open Questions

1. **Environment Variables**: Are there any environment-specific configurations that need special handling?
2. **Third-party Integrations**: Are there any external services or APIs that might be affected by the migration?
3. **Deployment**: Will the deployment process need to be updated for Next.js?
4. **State Management**: Should we consider updating React Query setup to leverage Next.js app router patterns?
5. **Testing**: Should we set up Next.js specific testing configurations during migration?
